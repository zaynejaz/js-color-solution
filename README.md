# Hex Color Display
Created a simple JS application (without typing any JS language or HTML markup) to show the color of a user's Hex code value input. 
Only typed in the comments and all code and markup was generated automatically using GitHub Copilot.
The only item entered was the HTML markup "<!DOCTYPE html>"
